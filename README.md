# 🚀 Water Bottle Rocket: Acceleration During Lift-Off

## 🌟 Project Overview

This project investigates how the acceleration of a water bottle rocket during its lift-off phase depends on key parameters. By partially filling a bottle with water and pressurizing it with air, thrust is generated as water is expelled. This study combines experimental data and simulations to understand and optimize the rocket's performance.
